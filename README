--- creating/updating simple files ---
in the bash shell use:
cat > filename {to then type your text & hit enter, CTRL + D to save}
cat >> filename {same as above, this time it appends file}


---------------- Git help
git add {filename or LINUX-style search combo string thing}
git commit -a {stage any previously staged files & commit everything}
git commit -m 'Some note about this commit' {this avoids the need to enter VIM to make notes about this commit}
----- common commit usage ---
git commit -am
